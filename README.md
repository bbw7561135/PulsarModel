The goal here is to apply electrodynamics and visualization techniques to see what the radiation from a pulsar looks like.

The simplest model of a pulsar I could think of is derived as follows:
   A pulsar is a sphere which rotates on some axis.
   The plasma within the pulsar behaves as a current.
   The magnetic axis of the pulsar's current is offset from the rotation axis.
   Thus, I am modeling the pulsar as a rotating loop of current whose normal vector is offset from the rotation axis.

It seems to me there are a few things I might want to do here:
   Model the loop itself (maybe animate it)
   Calculate the potentials or electric/magnetic fields (how would I visualize this?)
   Calculate Poynting vector and average pointing vector over a cycle

I should keep in mind the following:
   How can I determine the accuracy?
   What approximations are appropriate?

I'll probably also want to throw a LaTex doc in here to describe the actual mathematics.
